# Weekly Challenge #4 - Encrypted Thread

**For this challenge, you need to implement a Twitter/X/Threads experience where you can see a thread and reply to it. The entire data of the thread must live in the URL and be end to end encrypted. You can take inspiration from [this blog post that explains how it works on Excalidraw](https://blog.excalidraw.com/end-to-end-encryption/). The hashtag part of the URL must be below 2000 characters.** The idea of this challenge is to raise awareness on the fact that we can do end to end encryption in the browser and using data compression to make a large amount of content available, as well as figuring out how to work out data sharing.

### Winners

1. @luisperezphd wins $150 as this submission is going above and beyond: there's a full UI, account management, multi-thread support... Really impressive work! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-4-encrypted-thread/issues/5

2. Second place, @IamRstha wins $90! One of the trickiest aspect of this challenge is how do you share the URL and the flow around it. This submission decided to have a real time collaboration aspect in addition of the pure URL. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-4-encrypted-thread/issues/2
